            In a large frying pan or wok, heat oil to 325 degrees F. 
            Drain chicken in a colander to remove excess buttermilk. 
            Place tempura batter mix in a large paper bag; add chicken. 
            Close top and gently shake bag to coat chicken with tempura batter mix. 
            Remove chicken and fry, turning pieces over after 3 minutes. 
            Continue to fry, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides.
